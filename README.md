# Jekyll-TB
A simple, Twitter Bootstrap, Jekyll theme

I needed a bootstrap version of the Jekyll theme as a starting point for a lot of my projects. That's what this is. I added Bootstrap files, made the navigation bootstrap, made the footer stick to the bottom of the screen (but not stuck), and lastly moved the blog page off the front page.
